# Horiseon-A
This is a code refactor to improve the application accessibility by using semantic HTML elements such as `header`, `nav`, `footer` `section` etc. 
Web Accessibilty simply means being interactive for people to easily understand usage as well as eassier for assistive technology to access. Hence, making it easier for disabled persons to access.

The style.css file was also refactored to sync with the changes made on the index.HTML file. this is to allow for same configuration as the starter file given (as it is important to maintain web functionality and design).
